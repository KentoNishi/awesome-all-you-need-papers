## FAQ

### Why is it automated?
Because I'm lazy.

### Why is it only updated daily?
The arXiv API only updates search queries once a day.

### How can I contribute additional papers?
Please feel free to submit a PR! Additional papers not available on arXiv can be added in the `additional_papers.py` file.
